# Diabetes-Prediction
This repository contains a project on diabetes classification using several machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements.

## Models Evaluated

The following machine learning models were evaluated:

| Model                        | Accuracy Score |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| Random Forest Classifier      | 0.902597       |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier  | 0.902597       |
| Decision Tree Classifier      | 0.844156       |
| SVC                           | 0.837662       |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)     | 0.811688       |
| Logistic Regression           | 0.785714       |


## Results

The Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9026. Decision Tree, SVC, KNN, and Logistic Regression were also evaluated, with accuracy scores listed in the table above.

## Conclusion

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers are recommended for this diabetes classification task due to their higher accuracy. Further optimization and tuning can be applied to improve performance.
